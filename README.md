# TCS Quantum Apertures

This project is a part of the Quantum Apertures (QA) program, which develops novel radio receiver and aperture systems using quantum sensors as the receiving elements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Required python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tcs-quantum-apertures.git
```
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Build the project:
```
./build.sh
```
4. Run the test suite:
```
python test_suite.py
```

## Usage

The project includes four modules for controlling the quantum aperture sensors:
* Sensor Array Module
* Control Algorithm Module 1
* Control Algorithm Module 2
* Control Algorithm Module 3
* Control Algorithm Module 4

Each module is well documented in their respective .md files in the docs directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the project, please refer to the troubleshooting guide in the docs directory.

## Regulatory Compliance

This project is compliant with regulatory standards IL4-6, for more information please refer to the regulatory compliance guide in the docs directory.
